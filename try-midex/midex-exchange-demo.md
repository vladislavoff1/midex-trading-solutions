# Midex Exchange Demo

Midex Exchange Demo is an enhanced version of Midex Exchange. We test new technologies and experiment in this version, and then introduce them to the Midex Exchange.

Midex Exchange Demo is available at midex.net. This is our dev server. We made the dev server public so that it was easy to look at the latest developments.

In Midex Exchange Demo, you can test the trading core and the web platform. The trading core can be tested via the site, rest or fix api. Available order types: limit, market, stop and stop limit.

Learn more about the trading core and the web platform in the chapters of the [Trading Engine](../solutions/trading-engine/) and the [Web Platform](../solutions/web-platform/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are constantly changing, testing and updating the Midex Exchange Demo. Because of this, we sometimes disable the site or suspend trading. If this prevents you from testing the exchange, write to info@midex.com, we will think of something.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**If you want to check the performance - tell us**. We will switch the demo exchange to the battle mode - it is faster and more stable. In combat mode, debugging information for developers is disabled and all optimisations are enabled. Some optimisations are described in the chapter [Low-Latency optimisations](../solutions/trading-engine/performance-tuning.md).
{% endhint %}

## Demo access

We created a shared account on the demo exchange and credited virtual money to it.
